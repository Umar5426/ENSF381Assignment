            <p><span>John Doe:</span><br>
            <span>★★★★★</span> Great Service!!!<br><br>
            I recently moved due to work reasons and was in urgent need of some help adapting. I signed up as a last
            resort thinking "well it cant hurt" and it was super cheap! Here I am 6 months later, having mastered Spanish
            woohoo.. Overall, great service and definetly worth the investment!<br><br>
            </p>
            <p><span>Jane Doe:</span><br>
                <span>★★★★☆</span> Definitely worth a try<br><br>
                I recently started getting into German, since my husband is german, and I can confidently say that EduCare was
                SUCH a help fulfilling my dream of speaking to my partner in his native tongue. I will say it take some getting 
                used to.. almost like going back to school again, but nevertheless thier system works and EduCare is very accomodating.
